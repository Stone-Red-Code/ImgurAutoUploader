## Usage
1. Start the .exe file in the Release folder.
1. Take a screenshot with the windows screenshot tool by pressing `Win + Shift + S`
1. After that you should see a popup in the bottom right corner of your screen.
1. Then you can either upload the image directly to Imgur or Edit it by clicking on the preview image.
    * In the editor you can use the mouse wheel to change the pen size.
